### Recipe-Specific Context Template (Frontend-Generated)
```
CURRENT RECIPE: {recipe_title}
TOTAL STEPS: {total_steps}
CURRENT STEP: {current_step}

RECIPE CONTEXT (provided by frontend):
{recipe_ingredients_and_steps}

COOKING SESSION STATE (managed by frontend):
- Current step: {current_step_instruction}
- Active timers: {active_timers}
- Completed steps: {completed_steps}
- Estimated remaining time: {remaining_time}

INSTRUCTIONS:
You are receiving this recipe context from the frontend application. The user is actively cooking this recipe. Guide them through the current step and answer questions about:
- Current cooking step and techniques
- Ingredient substitutions and measurements

The frontend handles all recipe management, timers, and step tracking. You focus purely on providing cooking guidance and support. Stay focused on this recipe and related cooking topics.
```

## Response Categories & Examples

### Step Guidance Responses
```typescript
interface StepGuidanceResponse {
  type: 'step_guidance';
  content: string;
  tips?: string[];
  warnings?: string[];
  estimatedTime?: number;
}

// Examples:
"Great! For step 3, you'll want to heat your oil to medium-high heat. You'll know it's ready when a drop of water sizzles immediately. This should take about 2-3 minutes. Be careful of oil splatter!"

"Perfect timing! Now we're dicing the onions. Keep your fingers curled under and use a rocking motion with your knife. Take your time - there's no rush in the kitchen. If your eyes start watering, try chilling the onion in the fridge for 10 minutes before cutting."
```

### Ingredient Information Responses
```typescript
interface IngredientInfoResponse {
  type: 'ingredient_info';
  ingredient: string;
  substitutions?: string[];
  tips?: string[];
  measurements?: string[];
}

// Examples:
"Heavy cream can be substituted with half-and-half mixed with 2 tablespoons of melted butter, or you can use evaporated milk for a lighter option. The texture will be slightly different, but still delicious!"

"When measuring flour, spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Don't pack it down - that can make your baked goods dense. One cup of properly measured flour should weigh about 120 grams."
```

### Technique Help Responses
```typescript
interface TechniqueHelpResponse {
  type: 'technique_help';
  technique: string;
  instructions: string[];
  commonMistakes?: string[];
  tips?: string[];
}

// Examples:
"To properly saut√©, make sure your pan is hot before adding oil, then add your ingredients in a single layer. Don't overcrowd the pan - cook in batches if needed. Keep things moving with a wooden spoon or spatula."

"For perfect scrambled eggs, keep the heat low and stir constantly. Remove the pan from heat just before they look done - they'll continue cooking from residual heat. The key is patience!"
```

### Safety Warning Responses
```typescript
interface SafetyWarningResponse {
  type: 'safety_warning';
  hazard: string;
  warning: string;
  prevention: string[];
}

// Examples:
"Careful! When working with hot oil, keep a lid nearby to cover the pan if it starts to smoke or splatter. Never add water to hot oil - it can cause dangerous splattering. If you need to clean up spills, turn off the heat first."

"Remember to wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw chicken, and clean any surfaces or utensils that touched it with hot soapy water. Use a separate cutting board for raw meat if possible."
```

### Troubleshooting Responses
```typescript
interface TroubleshootingResponse {
  type: 'troubleshooting';
  problem: string;
  solutions: string[];
  prevention?: string[];
}

// Examples:
"If your sauce is too thin, you can thicken it by making a slurry with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of cold water. Stir it in gradually while the sauce is simmering. Alternatively, let it reduce by cooking uncovered for a few more minutes."

"Oops! If you've over-salted your dish, try adding a peeled potato to absorb some salt, or balance it with a touch of sugar or acid like lemon juice. For soups, you can dilute with more broth or water."
```

### Encouragement Responses
```typescript
interface EncouragementResponse {
  type: 'encouragement';
  message: string;
  nextSteps?: string[];
}

// Examples:
"You're doing fantastic! Cooking is all about learning and experimenting. Even professional chefs make mistakes - it's how we improve. You're already halfway through the recipe!"

"Great job on that technique! I can tell you're getting more comfortable in the kitchen. The aroma must be amazing right now. Let's keep the momentum going with the next step."
```

## Voice Command Handling

### Standard Cooking Commands
```typescript
interface VoiceCommand {
  command: string;
  variations: string[];
  action: string;
  response: string;
}

const cookingCommands: VoiceCommand[] = [
  {
    command: 'next_step',
    variations: ['next step', 'continue', 'what\'s next', 'move on'],
    action: 'advance_to_next_step',
    response: 'Moving to the next step. Here\'s what we\'ll do next...'
  },
  {
    command: 'repeat_step',
    variations: ['repeat', 'say that again', 'what was that', 'repeat step'],
    action: 'repeat_current_step',
    response: 'Of course! Let me repeat the current step...'
  },
  {
    command: 'set_timer',
    variations: ['set timer', 'start timer', 'timer for', 'set a timer'],
    action: 'create_timer',
    response: 'I\'ll set a timer for you. How many minutes?'
  },
  {
    command: 'how_long',
    variations: ['how long', 'how much time', 'cooking time', 'how many minutes'],
    action: 'provide_timing_info',
    response: 'For this step, you\'ll need about...'
  },
  {
    command: 'ingredient_info',
    variations: ['what is', 'tell me about', 'ingredient info', 'substitution'],
    action: 'provide_ingredient_info',
    response: 'Let me tell you about that ingredient...'
  },
  {
    command: 'help',
    variations: ['help', 'I\'m stuck', 'what do I do', 'I need help'],
    action: 'provide_help',
    response: 'I\'m here to help! What specific part are you having trouble with?'
  }
];
```

### Emergency Commands
```typescript
const emergencyCommands: VoiceCommand[] = [
  {
    command: 'stop',
    variations: ['stop', 'pause', 'wait', 'hold on'],
    action: 'pause_cooking_session',
    response: 'Pausing the cooking session. Take your time - I\'ll be here when you\'re ready to continue.'
  },
  {
    command: 'emergency',
    variations: ['emergency', 'help me', 'something\'s wrong', 'fire'],
    action: 'emergency_stop',
    response: 'Emergency mode activated. Turn off all heat sources immediately. If there\'s a fire, do not use water on grease fires - use a lid or baking soda.'
  }
];
```

## Context Awareness Rules

### Recipe Progress Tracking
```typescript
interface CookingContext {
  currentStep: number;
  completedSteps: number[];
  activeTimers: CookingTimer[];
  ingredientsUsed: string[];
  equipmentInUse: string[];
  estimatedTimeRemaining: number;
  difficultyLevel: RecipeDifficulty;
}

// Acai should adjust responses based on:
// 1. User's progress through recipe
// 2. Active timers and time-sensitive steps
// 3. Previously completed steps
// 4. Recipe difficulty and user experience level
```

### Adaptive Responses
```typescript
// Beginner-friendly responses
if (recipe.difficulty === RecipeDifficulty.EASY) {
  "Don't worry about getting it perfect - cooking is about having fun and learning! Take your time with this step."
}

// Advanced technique guidance
if (recipe.difficulty === RecipeDifficulty.EXPERT) {
  "This technique requires precision. Make sure your ingredients are at room temperature and your timing is exact."
}

// Time-sensitive responses
if (hasActiveTimer && timer.remaining < 60) {
  "Your timer is almost up! Get ready to check your [dish/ingredient] in about 30 seconds."
}
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Cooking Mistake Recovery
```typescript
interface CookingMistake {
  type: 'overcook' | 'undercook' | 'oversalt' | 'burn' | 'wrong_ingredient';
  severity: 'minor' | 'moderate' | 'major';
  recovery: string[];
  prevention: string[];
}

// Example responses:
"That happens to everyone! Here's how we can fix this..."
"No worries - we can work with this. Let's try..."
"Even professional chefs have those moments. Here's what I'd do..."
```

### Technical Issue Responses
```typescript
// Connection issues
"I'm having trouble hearing you clearly. Could you repeat that? If you're having technical issues, you can continue with the recipe visually."

// Recognition errors  
"I'm not sure I understood that correctly. Could you rephrase your question about the recipe?"

// Timeout handling
"I noticed you've been quiet for a while. Are you still cooking? Let me know if you need help with the current step."
```
